# Advanced Distributed Memory Management with Real-Time Analytics and Remote Monitoring

This repository contains the source code for an advanced distributed memory management system with real-time analytics and remote monitoring capabilities. The system is designed to efficiently manage memory resources across multiple embedded devices in a distributed environment.

## Project Objectives

- Extend the hierarchical memory allocation scheme to support distributed memory management across multiple embedded devices.
- Develop a RESTful API using Django REST Framework to expose memory management data and provide remote monitoring capabilities.
- Implement a notification system that generates real-time alerts when critical memory-related events occur.
- Explore the use of machine learning techniques to predict memory usage patterns and optimize memory allocation strategies.
- Implement robust security measures to protect the RESTful API and ensure secure communication between the embedded devices and the monitoring system.
- Develop mechanisms for dynamic memory reclamation in real-time.
- Continuously optimize the memory management system's performance.

## Technologies and Algorithms

The project utilizes the following technologies and algorithms:

- Data Structures: Maple Tree, Linked Lists, Binary Trees, Hash Tables, Distributed Data Structures (Distributed Hash Tables, Consistent Hashing, etc.)
- Algorithms: Best-Fit Allocation, First-Fit Allocation, Next-Fit Allocation, Defragmentation Algorithms, Distributed Algorithms (Consensus, Leader Election, etc.), Machine Learning Algorithms (Regression, Clustering, etc.)
- Programming Languages: Python (for RESTful API, machine learning, and analytics)
- Frameworks: Django REST Framework, Django, scikit-learn, TensorFlow (for machine learning)
- Embedded Platform: ARM-based microcontroller with Ethernet or WiFi connectivity

## Usage

To use the memory management system, follow these steps:

1. Connect the embedded devices to the network.
2. Access the RESTful API using a web browser or a command-line tool.
3. Retrieve real-time memory utilization statistics, allocation/deallocation rates, fragmentation levels, and other relevant metrics from each embedded device.
4. Configure the notification system to receive real-time alerts when critical memory-related events occur.
5. Train machine learning models using historical memory utilization data collected from the distributed devices.
